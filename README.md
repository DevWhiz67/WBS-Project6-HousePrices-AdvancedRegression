# WBS-Project6-HousePrices-AdvancedRegression
## Kaggle competition using different regression models to predict house prices

After having used the housing data for classifying houses into the categories "expensive" or "not expensive" in the last project, in this project we used the housing data in various regression models to predict exact house prices.

The models tested were:
- DecisionTreeRegressor
- SGDRegressor
- LinearRegression
- Random ForestRegression
- GradientBoostingRegressor

In addition, we used different scaling methods, different feature-selection methods (such as Variance Threshold, Collinearity, K Best, Recursive Feature Elimination, Select from model) as well as GridSearchCV to improve our scores. The highest scores I reached with the GradientBoostingRegressor and the model can be found in the notebook attached.
